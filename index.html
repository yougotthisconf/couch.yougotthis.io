transphobia, sexism, racism, ableism, homophobia, ageism and other types

loads of time now you have no commute? Let's look at how to allocate 
time and use co-working as a productivity tool, or even set up and run

the "graduates". Suze's tech community event methodologies have been

 whole world shook when the pandemic took over and completely changed

office - just basic everyday things stopped dead right in their tracks. 
Those of us who're able to work from home have been really lucky to do 
so and to have the support from the companies we work for. This 
experience is hard, especially for new hires to navigate and that 
preparation a commute gives us before we start work, gets substituted 
into a new routine or habit we need to take responsibility for. Our talk
 offers experiences, lessons and advice in hope that it encourages 
others and lets them know that even though it feels hard, you got this 
and you are not alone.</p><small>Massi Mapani <a href="https://twitter.com/mas_mapani">(@mas_mapani)</a>

 being transgender anywhere is not an easy task, let alone in the 
workplace and in a male-dominated field such as tech. Landing a new job 
after transitioning (or at any point during transitioning really) always
 comes accompanied with a variety of emotions. “Should I disclose my 
transness? If I don’t, am I lying?”, “I am afraid to tell my colleagues 
that I am trans, but I don’t feel okay with myself if I don’t”, “People 
can tell. I am a fraud.”</p><p>The thoughts mentioned above, and a 
thousand others are very much expected and an additional stress when 
trying to adapt to a new workplace with new people and expectations.

transgender person, and ways to keep mental peace while doing so, as 
well as celebrate and showcase the importance of diversity in the

 a month, we set aside an hour on the calendar and talk through the most

 low on runway, should we offer people wage cuts or do layoffs?"), 
sometimes pure imagination ("what if ICE wanted to become a customer of 
ours?").</p><p>We started doing this after we realized people always 
respond the worst when they're taken completely off guard. While the

 has the potential to be one of the most fulfilling aspects of working 
as an industry professional. But how can you ensure that you make a real
 and lasting impact on your mentee and their future? In this talk, we'll
 discuss some of the best ways to get to know your mentee from your 
initial conversation, how to set an agenda and goals for the 
relationship, ways to inspire compelling discussions about your mentee's
 future, and what practical steps you as the mentor can take on your own
 to be a positive influence on your mentee's career.</p><small>Julianne Burke <a href="https://twitter.com/julianne_burke">(@julianne_burke)</a>

 Your CV" takes the principles and ideas we use in User Experience (UX) 
design for web pages and apps, and applies them to the document that we 
send to prospective employers when we want to work for them.</p><p>There
 are very few unbreakable rules when writing a CV, so we'll consider 
your underlying objective, the realities of recruitment, and help you to
 feel confident making your own decisions about what to include and how 
to present it, and how to tailor it to specific roles.</p><p>You'll have
 a chance to work on a draft of your CV during the workshop, so please 
have any previous versions accessible, and it's also useful to have a 
job advert or two for the kind of roles you intend to apply to, so you 
can practice tailoring.</p><small>Matt Rose <a href="https://twitter.com/mrjesslynnrose">(@mrjesslynnrose)</a>

tech from another industry, or just looking to level up!</small></div></div><div class="workshop"><img src="Jan%2015%20&amp;%2016%202021%20-%20You%20Got%20This%20From%20Your%20Couch_files/claire-frame.png" alt="Claire Knight"><div class="info"><h2>Making Disagreements at Work Respectful and Productive</h2><p><b>This workshop will take place at 13:00 - 15:00 GMT.</b></p><p>Do
 you want to know how disagreements can be positive? How to be 
respectful while disagreeing? How to get to mutual understanding through
 productive discussion, and hopefully to agree on a path forward? Then 
this workshop could be for you! This workshop will be useful not only 
for code reviews and team discussions but in day to day life beyond 
tech. Through hands on exercise, you’ll leave the workshop with some 
extra tools to apply in a variety of situations, already have tried some
 of them out, and have further resources to look up if you want to 
explore this more.</p><small>Claire Knight <a href="https://twitter.com/krider2010">(@krider2010)</a>

 wants to get paid more for doing their job? Most of us, naturally. At 
the same time we believe things like "I'm junior, and juniors get paid 
around £25,000 for this job".</p><p>In reality, how much you're paid for
 your efforts in the workplace depends on what value you provide to your
 employer, but also on perception - how much value they think you 
provide. Perception is unfortunately influenced by factors that can be 
biased, but there is still a lot you can do to change how people see you
 and get paid more. Sometimes you need to negotiate, and other times you
 need to find new people who will pay you more.</p><p></p>Through 
anecdotes, practical exercises, and a bit of theory, this workshop aims 
to provide you with a framework of thinking of yourself as a paid 
professional, figuring out what you can charge for your services, and 
finding interesting well-paid work.<p></p><small>Emanuil Tolev <a href="https://twitter.com/emanuil_tolev">(@emanuil_tolev)</a>
